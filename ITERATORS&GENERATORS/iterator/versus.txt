""" ITERATOR VS ITERABLE """
"""
if we only use iterator class it would work just fine but when u need to iterate over one object multiple times it won't work properly 
it will just iterate over the object one time and the iterator will be exhausted. 
this problem can be catered by two means:
1)  by making a RESET function where u have to put self.count=0 in the function.
    its like starting the counter from the start or in simple words resetting the counter.
    using the reset function u would have to manually call the reset function in main.py everytime the iterator is exhausted.
2)  by making a separate ITERABLE CLASS which provides a separate object/reader everytime.
    the iterable class is capable of returning an iterator when passed to iter() or in a for loop.
    by making a separate iterable class u don't need a reset function and u don't have to call .reset() everytime u need to iterate over the same object
