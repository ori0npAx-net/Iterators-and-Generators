This repository focuses on the concept practice of ITERATORS AND GENERATORS.

Iterators folder--> whether we have to make an iterable class and an iterator class separately or if there is no need at all to make an iterable class.
Futheremore, it tests the Book and Reader code as an example.

Generator folder--> covers construction of a generator and "what a makes a generator good or bad" in the example folder.
Moving on, it covers the the 3 versions of Fibonacci(*from Worksheet of Week 15*)

*SIDE QUEST*:  _*random topic i learned*_
the print statement and how it effects the code when used with a Generator.
